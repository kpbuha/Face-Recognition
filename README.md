# Face-Recognition
Guys, I made a simple face recognition python project by using mainly opencv and haarcascade_frontal_face approach.

Which is first take sample by sample.py file and saved it in samples folder, 

Second it train over samples picture by using haarcascade approach which was i used in my this project 

third when we execute main face_recognition.py than it will print user verified successfully or user authentication failed

i also implement it in my different python project to unlock or start execution of it by verify user like lock\unlock by face recognition.
